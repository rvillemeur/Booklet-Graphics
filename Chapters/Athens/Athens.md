## Vector graphics in Athens

There are two different computer graphics: vector and raster graphics.
Raster graphics represent images as a collection of pixels. Vector graphics
is the use of geometric primitives such as points, lines, curves, or polygons
to represent images. These primitives are created using mathematical equations.

Both types of computer graphics have advantages and disadvantages.
The advantages of vector graphics over raster are:

- smaller size,
- ability to zoom indefinitely,
- moving, scaling, filling, and rotating do not degrade the quality of an image.

Ultimately, pictures on a computer are displayed on a screen with a specific
display dimension. However, while raster graphics doesn't scale very well when
the resolution differs too much from the picture resolution, vector graphics
are rasterized to fit the display they will appear on. Rasterization is the
technique of taking an image described in a vector graphics format and
transforming it into a set of pixels for output on a screen.

Morphic is the way to do graphics with Pharo.
However, most existing canvases are pixel based, and not vector based.
This can be an issue with current IT ecosystems, where the resolution can differ from machine to machine (desktop, tablet, phones, etc...)

Enter Athens, a vector-based graphic API. Under the scene, it can either use
balloon Canvas, or the Cairo graphic library for the rasterization phase.

### Example

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to understand the example below:
SD: problem with parentheses.

```smalltalk
| surface |
surface := AthensCairoSurface   extent: 400@400.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas | 

	| paint font |
	paint := (PolymorphSystemSettings pharoLogoForm) asAthensPaintOn: canvas.
 
	canvas setPaint: (
		 (LinearGradientPaint from: 0@0  to: 400@400) 
			 colorRamp: {  
			  0 -> (Color red alpha: 0.8).
			  0.166 -> (Color orange alpha: 0.8).
			  0.332 -> (Color yellow alpha: 0.8).
			  0.5 -> (Color green alpha: 0.8).
			  0.664 -> (Color blue alpha: 0.8).
			  0.83 -> (Color magenta alpha: 0.8).
			  1 -> (Color purple alpha: 0.8). 
		 }).

canvas drawShape: (0@0 extent: 400@400). 
paint maskOn: canvas.
 
font := LogicalFont familyName: 'Source Sans Pro' pointSize: 30.
canvas setFont: font.
canvas setPaint:(  (LinearGradientPaint from: 0@0  to: 100@150)
 colorRamp: {  
  0 -> (Color white alpha: 0.9).
  1 -> (Color black alpha: 0.9).}).
canvas pathTransform translateX: 20 Y: 180 + (font getPreciseAscent); scaleBy: 1.1; rotateByDegrees: 25.

canvas drawString: 'Hello Athens in Pharo'

"canvas draw."
].

surface asForm
```

### Athens details

`AthensSurface` and its subclass `AthensCairoSurface` will initialize a new surface.
The surface represents the area in pixels where your drawing will be rendered. You
never draw directly on the surface. Instead, you specify what you want to display
on the canvas, and Athens will render it on the area specified by the surface.

The class `AthensCanvas` is the central object used to perform drawing on an `AthensSurface`
A canvas is not directly instantiated but used through a call like
`surface drawDuring: [:canvas | .... ]`

The Athens drawing model relies on a three-layer model. Any drawing process
takes place in three steps:

- First, a painting must be defined, which may be a color, a color gradient, or a bitmap.
- Then a `path` is created, which includes one or more vector primitives, i.e., lines, TrueType fonts, BÃ©zier curves, etc... This path will define the shape that is then rendered.
- Finally, the result is drawn to the Athens surface, which is provided by the back-end for the output.

#### Paint

Paint can be:

- a single color, defined with the message `color:`
- A radial gradient paint, defined through object `RadialGradientPaint`
- a linear gradient paint, defined through object `LinearGradientPaint`
- a bitmap you can get by sending *asAthensPaintOn:* to a `Form`.

The way the paint is applied in the canvas is specified as *Fill* or *Stroke* that we will see in detail:

- `setPaint:` message will fill the Paint in the area defined by the path.
- `setStrokePaint:` message will set the paint as a virtual pen along the path.

Let's see some examples to better understand how it works.

#### Stroke paint (a pen that goes around the path)

The stroke operation takes a virtual pen along the path. It allows the source to transfer through the mask in a thin (or thick) line around the path

```smalltalk
|surface|
surface := AthensCairoSurface extent: 200@200.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas | 
        surface clear: Color white.
        canvas setStrokePaint:  Color red.
        canvas drawShape: (20@20 extent: 160@160). 
].

surface asForm
```

The paint can be customized like

```smalltalk
|surface|
surface := AthensCairoSurface extent: 200@200.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas | 
        surface clear: Color white.
        canvas setStrokePaint:  Color red.
        canvas paint dashes: #( "fill"5   "gap" 15) offset: 5.
        canvas paint capSquare.
        canvas paint width: 10.
        canvas drawShape: (20@20 extent: 160@160). 
].

surface asForm
```

#### Fill paint (a paint that fill the area defined by the path)

A gradient will let you create a gradient of color, either linear or radial.

The color ramp is a collection of associations with keys - floating point values
between 0 and 1 and values with Colors, for example:
```
{0 -> Color blue . 0.5 -> Color white. 1 -> Color red}.
```

Full example with all paints:

Paint bitmap needs to be moved to the place you want to have them drawn. Otherwise, they will stay in the top left corner of the surface area. The message `loadIdentity` is necessary for the next paint as the previous `paintTransform` will continue to apply to the new paint definition.

We can use the same paint definition with stroke paint move. However, in this situation, the paint will only appear in the thickness of the stroke line.

```language=smalltalk
|surface|
surface := AthensCairoSurface extent: 200@200.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas |
surface clear: (Color purple alpha: 0.3).
"linear gradient fill"
    canvas setPaint:  ((LinearGradientPaint from: 0@0  to: 100@100) colorRamp: {  0 -> Color white. 1 -> Color black }).
    canvas drawShape: (0@0 extent: 100@100).

"plain color fill"
    canvas setPaint:  (Color yellow alpha: 0.9).
    canvas drawShape: (100@0 extent: 200@100).

"Bitmap fill"
    canvas setPaint: (PolymorphSystemSettings pharoLogoForm asAthensPaintOn: canvas ).
    canvas paintTransform translateX: 0 Y: 135.
    canvas paintTransform scaleBy: 0.25.
    canvas drawShape: (0@100 extent: 100@200).

"Radial gradient fill"
    canvas paintTransform loadIdentity.
    canvas setPaint: ((RadialGradientPaint new) colorRamp: { 0 -> Color white. 1 -> Color black }; center: 150@150; radius: 50; focalPoint: 180@180).
    canvas drawShape: (100@100 extent: 200@200).

 ].
surface asForm 
```

Start and stop points are references to the current shape being drawn.
Example:
Create a vertical gradient

```language=smalltalk
canvas
    setPaint:
        (canvas surface
            createLinearGradient:
                {(0 -> Color blue).
                (0.5 -> Color white).
                (1 -> Color red)}
            start: 0@200
            stop: 0@400). 
    canvas drawShape: (0@200 extent: 300@400).
```

Create a horizontal gradient:

```language=smalltalk
canvas
    setPaint:
        (canvas surface
            createLinearGradient:
                {(0 -> Color blue).
                (0.5 -> Color white).
                (1 -> Color red)}
            start: 0@200
            stop: 300@200). 
    canvas drawShape: (0@200 extent: 300@400).
```

Create a diagonal gradient:

```language=smalltalk
canvas
    setPaint:
        (canvas surface
            createLinearGradient:
                {(0 -> Color blue).
                (0.5 -> Color white).
                (1 -> Color red)}
            start: 0@200
            stop: 300@400). 
    canvas drawShape: (0@200 extent: 300@400).
```

### Path

Athens always has an active path.

Use `AthensPathBuilder` or `AthensSimplePathBuilder` to build a path
They will assemble segments for you

The method `createPath:` exists in all important Athens class: `AthensCanvas`,
`AthensSurface`, and  `AthensPathBuilder`.
The message `createPath: aPath`

Using it returns a new path:

```language=smalltalk
surface createPath: [:builder |
  builder
   absolute;
   moveTo: 100@100;
   lineTo: 100@300;
   lineTo: 300@300;
   lineTo: 300@100;
   close ].
```

Here are some helper messages in `AthensSimplePathBuilder`:

- `pathStart`
- `pathBounds` gives the limit of the bounds associated with the path

If you want to build a path using only a straight line, you can use the class `AthensPolygon`.

|path builder Messages  |Object Segment     |comment                     |
|~~~~~~~~~~~-|~~~~~~~~~-|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
|ccwArcTo: angle:       |AthensCCWArcSegment|counter clock wise segment  |
|cwArcTo:angle:         |AthensCWArcSegment |clock wise segment          |
|lineTo:                |AthensLineSegment  |straight line               |
|moveTo:                |AthensMoveSegment  |start a new contour         |
|curveVia: to:          |AthensQuadSegment  |quadric bezier curve        |
|curveVia: and: to:     |AthensCubicSegment |Cubic bezier curve          |
|reflectedCurveVia: to: |AthensCubicSegment |Reflected cubic bezier curve|
|string: font:          |                   |specific to cairo           |
|close                  |AthensCloseSegment |close the current contour   |

### Coordinate class: **Absolute** or **Relative**

#### Absolute: absolute coordinate from surface coordinate

This will draw a square in a surface whose extent is 400@400 using an absolute move.

```language=smalltalk
builder absolute;
   moveTo: 100@100;
   lineTo: 100@300;
   lineTo: 300@300;
   lineTo: 300@100;
   close
```

relative: each new move is relative to the previous one.
This will draw a square in a surface whose extent is 400@400 using relative move.

```language=smalltalk
 builder relative ;
  moveTo: 100@100;
  lineTo: 200@0;
  lineTo: 0@200;
  lineTo: -200@0;
  close
```

#### moving

- moveTo: -> move path to a specific point to *initiate* drawing.

#### straight line

- lineTo: line path from previous point to target point.

#### arcs

- `ccwArcTo: endPt angle: rot`. Add a counter-clockwise arc segment, starting from current path endpoint and ending at andPt. Angle should be specified in radians.
- `cwArcTo: endPt angle: rot`. Add a clockwise arc segment, starting from current path endpoint and ending at andPt. Angle should be specified in radians.

`cwArcTo:angle:` and `ccwArcTo: angle:` will draw circular arc, connecting previous segment endpoint and current endpoint of given angle, passing in
clockwise or counter clockwise direction. The angle must be specified in Radian.

Please remember that the circumference of a circle is equal to 2 Pi  R.
If R = 1, half of the circumference is equal to PI, which is the value of half a circle.

#### curves

- curveVia: cp1 and: cp2 to: aPoint. Add a cubic bezier curve starting from the current path endpoint, using control points cp1, cp2 and ending at aPoint.
- curveVia: cp1 to: aPoint. Add a quadric bezier curve, starting from the current path endpoint, using control point cp1, and ending at aPoint.
- reflectedCurveVia: cp2 to: aPoint. Add a reflected cubic bezier curve, starting from the current path endpoint and ending at aPoint. The first control point is calculated as a reflection from the current point, if the last command was also a cubic bezier curve. Otherwise, the first control point is the current point. The second control point is cp2.

#### curveVia: to: and |curveVia: and: to

This call is related to the bezier curve. A BÃ©zier curve consists of two or more
 control points, which define the size and shape of the line. The first and
 last points mark the beginning and end of the path, while the intermediate
 points define the path's curvature.

 More detail on Bezier curve on available at: https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo


#### Close the path

- close. Close the path contour, between the initial point, and the last reached point.




Here is a full example with all family of paths.

```language=smalltalk
| surface |
surface := AthensCairoSurface extent: 100@100.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas |
 surface clear: Color white.
   canvas setStrokePaint: Color red.
 canvas paint width: 5.
   canvas drawShape: (
  canvas createPath: [ :builder | 
       builder
        absolute;
      moveTo: 25@25;
      lineTo: 50@37.5;
   relative;
      lineTo: 25@(-12.5);
   absolute;
   cwArcTo: 75 @ 75 angle: 90 degreesToRadians;
   curveVia: 50@60 and: 50@90 to: 25@75;
      close
  ]
 ).
].
surface asForm 
```

#### Path transformation

A path can be rotated, translated, and scaled so you can adapt it to your needs.
For example, you can define a path in your own coordinate system, and then
scale it to match the size of your surface extent.

```
can pathTransform loadIdentity.
can pathTransform translateX: 30 Y: 30.
can pathTransform rotateByDegrees: 30.
can pathTransform scaleBy: 1.2.
```

### Drawing

Either you set the shape first and then you call **draw**, or you call the
convenient method **drawShape:** directly with the path to draw as argument

#### drawing text

```
font := LogicalFont familyName: 'Arial' pointSize: 10.
canvas setFont: font.
canvas setPaint: Color pink.
canvas pathTransform translateX: 20 Y: 20 + (font getPreciseAscent); scaleBy: 2; rotateByDegrees: 25.
canvas drawString: 'Hello Athens in Pharo'
```

#### Drawing using a mask

Athens mask will paint the canvas. It fills the area with the current fill pattern and blends it by whatever alpha is for that pixel on the mask.

Here, the mask the the Pharo

*Note RDV: this API is part of*AthensCairoPatternPaint*but is not in the standard messages of Athens API. I'm wondering if we should include it.*

```smalltalk
| surface |
surface := AthensCairoSurface   extent: 400@120.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas | |paint font|

paint := (PolymorphSystemSettings pharoLogoForm) asAthensPaintOn: canvas.

canvas setPaint: (
 (LinearGradientPaint from: 0@0  to: 400@120)
 colorRamp: {  
  0 -> (Color red alpha: 0.8).
  1 -> (Color yellow alpha: 0.8).
 })..


canvas drawShape: (0@0 extent: 400@120).
paint maskOn: canvas.
].

surface asForm
```

### Practicing Athens drawing

To help you practice your Athens drawing, you can use Athens sketch, migrated from SmalltalkHub which is available at
[Athens Sketch: https://github.com/rvillemeur/AthensSketch](https://github.com/rvillemeur/AthensSketch)
